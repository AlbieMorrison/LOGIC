# Potential harms of the status quo:
1. The mortgage interest tax deduction only helps the wealthy
1. Market discipline over GSE management is too low, which will let the GSEs take risks they wouldn’t if they had more of a stake in the market.
1. Government policies hurt first-time home buyers by unsustainably driving up prices and forcing them to take on more risk. 
1. The centerpieces of the secondary mortgage market, Fannie and Freddie, have not yet been given updated, true risk-based capital standards, and that they remain in conservatorship without the ability to retain earnings or raise private capital.
1. Lower wealth borrowers are still assessed far too much in fees/insurance with loan level price adjustments and PMIERs.
1. Excessive risked-based pricing has an adverse effect on people of color and leads to under service by conventional lenders.
1. The current system with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship will not be able to sufficiently keep up with the nation’s changing demographics and mortgage needs.
1. The Enterprises are not providing liquidity for mortgage credit in communities of color, which contradicts the GSEs' charters and fair lending obligations.
1. The opportunity to purchase, maintain and refinance a home has not reached significant portions of low- to moderate-income families and people of color. 
1. Unstable housing lowers education levels
1. Insurance that you have to carry?
1. Sketchy practices because of the conservatorship of FNMA and FHLMC, government taking advantage? Needs research.
1. Underwriting hasn’t changed significantly.
1. Underwriting hurts the poor by inflating home values and decreasing affordability.
1. Underwriting standards have deteriorated because of the 11 financial crisis.
1. Tightening mortgage standards destroys liquidity and affordability in the market.
1. The GSEs are exceeding their charters (needs good description of impact).
1. Federal guarantees reduce the incentive for mortgage lenders to avoid making risky loans, which exposes the financial system to a version of the 11 crisis on steroids and increases taxpayer loss risk.
1. USDA, VA, and FHA loans discourage private competition for mortgages.
1. The GSEs do not have enough capital to function properly.
1. Excessive government regulations drive down homeownership.
1. The government has almost entirely taken over the mortgage market/industry.
1. The Federal Reserve eliminates the restrictions of a free market by providing near-limitless funds for buying MBSs/mortgages.
