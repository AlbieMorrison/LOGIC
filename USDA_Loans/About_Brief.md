# How it works

There are three types of USDA Rural Development loans, only two of which are for financing the purchase of single-family dwellings. The first is called the Rural Home Loan Direct Program (RHLDR), and the second is known as the Single Family Home Loan Guarantee Program (SFHLGP) (those are my acronyms). Both are zero-down payment, 100% financing available loan options, and they are oriented exclusively toward low-income households. (From official USDA websites)

# For Both

## Where does the money come from?

> “USDA programs are funded through the annual Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill Rural Home Loan Direct Program” – Arthur Scott of NACo (National Association of Counties), Associate Legislative Director of Agriculture and Rural Affairs for 8 years, previous Assistant to the Chief of Staff for the US Senate, “Maintain Funding for USDA RDPs” (Rural Development Programs) (https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020%20USDA%20RD%20FS_Leg%20%28002%29.pdf)

## What are eligible areas for loans?

USDA Direct Loans and Guaranteed Housing Loans are only available for areas of the country classified as “rural”.

> “Generally, rural areas with a population less than 35,000 are eligible.” – USDA Single Family Direct Home Loans page (https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs/single-family-housing-direct-home-loans)

Applicants can use the USDA’s Property Eligibility Tool (https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do?pageAction=sfp) to determine for a specific address whether it could be eligible for a USDA loan.

## What is the borrower responsible for?

Insurance:

> “Borrowers are responsible for obtaining and continuously maintaining hazard insurance throughout the term of the loan.” – USDA Direct Loan Applicant Orientation Guide (see #4 in Resources)

## Securitization

All USDA loans are securitized by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae)

> “USDA does not purchase and securitize loans. Instead, USDA loans are delivered to the secondary market through Ginnie Mae’s guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.” –  USDA Rural Development Overview (https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/affordable-mortgage-lending-center/guide/part-1-docs/usda-overview.pdf)

## Loan Guarantees

USDA loans are backed by the USFG through GNMA, so investors in the securities made of these loans have confidence that their investment is backed by the full faith and credit of the USFG.

# Rural Home Loan Direct Program (Direct Loan Program)

## What does it do?

> “this program assists low- and very-low-income applicants obtain decent, safe, and sanitary housing in eligible rural areas by providing payment assistance to increase an applicant’s repayment ability.” – USDA Direct Loan Program Fact Sheet (https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fact-sheet/508_RD_FS_RHS_SFH502Direct.pdf)

## What governs this program?

> “The Housing Act of 1949 as amended, 7 CFR, Part 3550” – USDA Direct Loan Program Fact Sheet (see #5 in Resources for the CFR part)

## Application

Application for RD loans is done directly through the USDA, by contacting an agent at your state’s USDA Rural Development office. There are several forms and pre-training requirements listed at the USDA Single Family Direct Home Loans page under the “To Apply” tab. Effectively, you must have a decent credit score (640 or above ideally), not be able to get a loan elsewhere for an affordable amount, and have low income as defined in the USDA’s limit map (see #1 in Resources).

## Income Eligibility

Income cutoffs are defined by the USDA for each county.

Income categories tend to follow these ranges (ranges depend on family size and are approximate, they do not cover the full range of the data):

- Very Low Income: ~$30k - $45k
- Low Income: ~$45k - $75k

This program helps people with low and very low income to find a decent home in approved rural areas.

# Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP, Guaranteed Housing Program)

## What does it do?

> “This no downpayment, 100% financing program assists approved lenders in providing low- and moderate-income households the opportunity to own adequate, modest, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings as their primary residence in eligible rural areas.” – USDA SFHGLP Fact Sheet (https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fact-sheet/508_RD_FS_RHS_SFHGLP.pdf)

## What governs this program?

> “7 CFR part 3555 - This part sets forth policies for the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) administered by USDA Rural Development. It addresses the requirements of Section 502(h) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, and includes policies regarding originating, servicing, holding, and liquidating SFHGLP loans.” –  USDA SFHGLP Fact Sheet (see #6 in Resources for the CFR part)

## Application

> “Interested applicants can apply for a Section 502 Guaranteed Loan through USDA Rural Development’s network of approved lenders. These approved lenders are also your point of contact for any questions or scenarios you wish to have reviewed for possible eligibility.” – USDA website (https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs/single-family-housing-guaranteed-loan-program)

These lenders range from small banks to credit union and others (see #2 and #3 in Resources for the documents pertaining to becoming an approved lender).

## Income Eligibility

Income cutoffs are defined by the USDA for each county.

Income categories tend to follow these ranges (ranges depend on family size and are approximate, they do not cover the full range of the data):

- Very Low Income: ~$30k - $45k
- Low Income: ~$45k - $75k
- Moderate Income: ~$90k - $120k (not eligible for a Direct Loan)

This program helps all people in those three income categories to find a decent home in approved rural areas.
