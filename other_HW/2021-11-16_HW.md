# Does the current system incentivize risky mortgages?

The current system's implicit government guarantee of Fannie and Freddie's encourages risky practices among investors in their MBSs, homebuyers, and even Fannie and Freddie themselves.

> "Ordinarily, as a firm takes on more risk, the cost of its debt goes up to compensate its debt holders for higher expected (predicted) losses. However, with the government implicitly guaranteeing the debt, the GSEs' debt holders did not demand full compensation for increases in the GSEs' risk. As a result, the GSEs were incent[iviz]ed to and did take more risk, especially in the form of interest rate risk in their retained portfolios and credit risk through their purchases of higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. Further, to the extent that the GSEs reduced the cost of obtaining a mortgage loan, they encouraged homebuyers to take on more debt, exposing households to more housing price and employment-related risk."

> "As is now well understood, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac posed a systemic risk to the US financial system. This risk mainly arose because the debt they issued to fund their portfolio purchases were viewed by the market as 'implicitly guaranteed.' That is, investors assumed that the government would back the debt regardless of the financial condition of the GSEs. With this implicit government guarantee, the GSEs issued debt at a relatively low cost, operated without bondholder market discipline, and undertook excessive risks within their portfolios."

The incentive to originate, sell, and resell risky mortgage loans could be a major harm of the status quo.

# The "too big to fail" problem with the current home mortgage industry

The “too big to fail” problem with the current mortgage industry is that if either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac fails to operate properly or goes belly-up, the entire American economy could crash. According to Fannie and Freddie’s 2021 quarter 3 reports, their combined assets are over 7.1 trillion US dollars. (https://www.fanniemae.com/media/41811/display, http://www.freddiemac.com/investors/financials/pdf/10q_3q21.pdf)
That is nearly a third of the US 2021 quarter 3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $23.17 trillion USD (Bureau of Economic Analysis, October 28, 2021, https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/gdp3q21_adv.pdf), which is a massive risk to the economy and taxpayers.

> "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are too big to fail and must be kept alive to avoid a crisis of 'unspeakable magnitude,' a former top Federal Reserve policy-maker said on Friday.  
'Clearly they must be supported. They (the U.S. government) cannot allow that amount of assets ... to go into limbo,' said William Poole, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who retired at the end of March, 'It would produce a worldwide financial crisis of unspeakable magnitude if they were allowed to default.'"

> "As private entities, the GSEs are engaged solely in a very risky activity – guaranteeing the performance of real estate loans. Indeed, some see real estate lending as the most significant driver – almost the definition – of systemic risk itself... Charles Calomiris, a professor at the Columbia Business School, has noted since well before the previous financial crisis that the use of short-term debt with procyclical pricing to finance risky and usually illiquid real estate assets is particularly vulnerable to system-wide shock. This relationship was considered so particularly fraught with danger that prior to 1913, nationally chartered banks were prohibited from holding any real estate at all. The GSEs not only participate in a systemically risky activity – they dominate it."  
<br>--Douglas Holtz-Eakins, president of the American Action Forum, former Chief Economist of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers and 6<sup>th</sup> Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on June 25, 2019, "Should Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be Designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions?" (https://www.americanactionforum.org/print/?url=https://www.americanactionforum.org/testimony/should-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-be-designated-as-systemically-important-financial-institutions/)

Even Mike Crapo, the last chairman of the US Senate Commitee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said in Senate Hearing 116-66,

> "Fannie and Freddie are clearly too big to fail. We all know it,
and the 2008 bailout proved it.  
Today Fannie Mae has a larger balance sheet than any financial
institution in the United States and the second largest balance
sheet of any public company in the world. Freddie Mac is not far
behind.  
Collectively they hold $5.48 trillion in assets. That is $5,000 billion.  
Additionally, both companies hold far less capital and are far
more leveraged than any other currently designated SIFI.
As FHFA Director Calabria recently said, 'With a leverage ratio
of nearly a thousand to one, their balance-sheet capital cushion is
razor thin.'"
